# ShadergraphSnow
Unity Project Files for YouTube Shadergraph Tutorial 

Unity walkthrough tutorial on how I created my Sparkle Snow shader. Final shader produced has two variations, we have a textural version that uses a normal map for the surface information, and then we have a fully procedural version also. Attributes on both include Snow Color, Surface Information ( Normals via texture or procedural ), Fresnel and of course, the all important 'Sparkles' attributes.
